WHAT  IS  AN  EXPERIMENT  ???

Each experiment consists of 1 vector of random size [0,1000000].

This vector is the input of the MergeSort and QuickSort
algorithms and the time used is saved on
the corresponding timeM.log and timeQ.log files.

After each sorting the output of each algorithm is checked
to see it's an ascending vector.

The previous process is repeated 2 more times until we have
3 times saved on the timeM.log and timeQ.log.

The average of this 3 times is what we call an experiment.

LOG_M.log and LOG_Q.log contain those averages.

HOW TO  GENERATE  MULTIPLE  EXPERIMENTS ???

  1 -   GENERATE A.OUT FOM BUCLE.C
        @:~$ gcc bucle.c
        
  2 -   TO PERFORM 10 EXPERIMENTS
        @:~$ ./a.out 10
  
  3 -   AFTER 10 EXPERIMENTS ALL .log FILES WILL BE IN 
        THE LATEST FOLDER LOCATED IN THE 'REGISTRE' FOLDER
       
        THE DATA ON .log FILES CONSISTS OF 3 COLUMNS:
        / time [ms] / seed / vector_size /
     
  4 -   DELETING ALL .inp, .out, .txt AFTER EXPERIENCE
        @:~$ make rm
